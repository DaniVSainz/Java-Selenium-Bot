# cheekyJavaProject

While working at my internship i kept hearing about selenium and eventually curiosity got the best of me and i wanted to see what it was about.I needed a project to have a fun way of learning and after seeing a list of top 250 active github users by commits that needed some amount of followers to get on I had an idea.

I made a multithreaded selenium bot that mass made emails and registered github users and followed my account.I didn't really intend for it to be permanent or have the impact it did.However after running it for short of an hour on 6 threads the next day i woke up to being the most trending github user.

Was a very fun project and way of learning something new.
